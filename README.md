I used these topic in this project.

- Static, Instance, Local, Constant, Read-Only Variables
- var and dynamic keywords
- Implicit, Explicit, Boxing & Unboxing Type Casting
- Conditional Statements: if, else, nested if, switch
- Loops: for, while, do-while, foreach
- Exception Handling: try-catch, throw
- StringBuilder for performance
